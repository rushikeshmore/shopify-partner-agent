# PartnerAgent

MCP server that gives Claude access to your Shopify Partner analytics. 15 tools covering revenue metrics, churn analysis, retention cohorts, and merchant data — everything HeyMantle charges $49-999/mo for, powered by Claude's natural language intelligence.

## Why

Existing Shopify MCP servers connect to the **Admin API** (store operations). None connect to the **Partner API** (app developer analytics). PartnerAgent fills this gap.

Ask Claude things like:
- "What's my MRR?"
- "Who uninstalled my app recently and why?"
- "Show me retention cohorts for the last 6 months"
- "Compare all my apps this quarter"

## Analytics Formulas

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| MRR | Sum of active monthly subscription charges (annual ÷ 12) |
| Net New MRR | New + Reactivation + Expansion - Contraction - Churn |
| Revenue Churn % | (Churned MRR + Contraction) / Starting MRR × 100 |
| Logo Churn % | Uninstalled merchants / Starting merchants × 100 |
| LTV | ARPU × Average lifespan |
| ARPU | Total net revenue / Active merchants |
| Retention | Revenue in month N / Revenue in month 0 (per cohort) |
